Academic Free License (AFL) v. 3.0
</p>
<p>
This Academic Free License (the &quot;License&quot;) applies to any
original work of authorship (the &quot;Original Work&quot;) whose owner
(the &quot;Licensor&quot;) has placed the following licensing notice
adjacent to the copyright notice for the Original Work:
</p>
<p>
Licensed under the Academic Free License version 3.0
</p>
<p>
1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the
copyright, to do the following:
</p>
<p>
a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a
collective work;
</p>
<p>
b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original
Work, thereby creating derivative works (&quot;Derivative Works&quot;)
based upon the Original Work;
</p>
<p>
c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative
Works to the public, under any license of your choice that does not
contradict the terms and conditions, including Licensor&#8216;s reserved
rights and remedies, in this Academic Free License;
</p>
<p>
d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
</p>
<p>
e) to display the Original Work publicly.
</p>
<p>
2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or
controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as
furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use,
sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and
Derivative Works.
</p>
<p>
3) Grant of Source Code License. The term &quot;Source Code&quot; means the
preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all
available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work.
Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of
the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor
distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by
placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information
repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient
access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original
Work.
</p>
<p>
4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the
names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks
or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from
this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except
as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to
Licensor&#8216;s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any
other intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use,
sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims
other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted
to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the
Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit
Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any
Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
</p>
<p>
5) External Deployment. The term &quot;External Deployment&quot; means the
use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative
Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be
used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or
communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended
for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license
hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original
Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).
</p>
<p>
6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any
Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark
notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices
of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an
&quot;Attribution Notice.&quot; You must cause the Source Code for any
Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice
reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the
Original Work.
</p>
<p>
7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants
that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights
granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to
You under the terms of this License with the permission of the
contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly
stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Original Work is provided
under this License on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY,
either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of
non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No
license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under this
disclaimer.
</p>
<p>
8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal
theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result
of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without
limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure
or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This
limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law
prohibits such limitation.
</p>
<p>
9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to
this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance
of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or
communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make
a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of
recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your
rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your
right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so
without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law
and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect
copyright exceptions and limitations (including &quot;fair use&quot; or
&quot;fair dealing&quot;). This License shall terminate immediately and You
may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).
</p>
<p>
10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate
automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to
You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a
cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that
the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not
apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the
Original Work with other software or hardware.
</p>
<p>
11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to
this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein
the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business,
and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law
provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the
Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination
shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent
law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the
termination of this License.
</p>
<p>
12) Attorneys&#8217; Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this
License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and costs incurred in connection with such
action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the
termination of this License.
</p>
<p>
13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable.
</p>
<p>
14) Definition of &quot;You&quot; in This License. &quot;You&quot;
throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an
individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with
all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, &quot;You&quot;
includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common
control with you. For purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot;
means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii)
ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or
(iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
</p>
<p>
15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises
not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.
</p>
<p>
16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright (c) 2005
Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate
this License without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to
modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works.
However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or
communicate your modified version (the &quot;Modified License&quot;) and
apply it to other original works of authorship subject to the following
conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License
is the &quot;Academic Free License&quot; or &quot;AFL&quot; and you may not
use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace
the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice
&quot;Licensed under &lt;insert your license name here&gt;&quot; or with a
notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this
License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open
source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open
Source Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and
certification process.
